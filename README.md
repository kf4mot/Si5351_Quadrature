# Si5351_Quadrature

Clock generator with quadrature phase signal and OLED display.  
It's can be used in many RF applications.

## Material list

1 [arduino](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2488 "Arduino")  
1 [Si5351A module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2045 "Si5351 module")  
1 [OLED screen display with 128x32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/661 "OLED Display")

## Little guide of usage

This code make 3 outputs CLK0, CLK1, and CLK2, it's make the same frequency in CLK0 and CLK1  
with a quadrature (90Â° of phase) from about 3.2 MHz and 56.2 MHz, CLK2 is an independant output.


The LED screen indications : 

**Clk|Frequency    |Phy**  
**0    3 500 000 Hz0-90**	<- Frequency and Phy For CLK0 and CLK1  
**2    6 000 000 Hz   0**	<- Frequency for CLK2  
**   720 000 000 Hz    **	<- Frequency for last PLL called  

Use the encoder to change the frequency, rotate counterclockwise (CW) to up the frequency,  
rotate anticlockwise (CCW) to down the frequency.  
To change the multiple of step make short one click on encoder.  
To jump from CLK0-1 to CLK2 frequency setup make a long push on encoder.
